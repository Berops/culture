## Tools
We use:
- [Slack](www.slack.com) for chat communication; incl. hooks from other tools (e.g. GitHub) and bots (e.g. [Github Release Notifier](https://github.com/justwatchcom/github-releases-notifier))
- [GitHub](www.github.com/berops) for private and public git repositories
- [GSuite](gsuite.google.com) for mailbox, cloud storage and other office tools
- [Google Cloud Platform](cloud.google.com) for hosting our infrastructure

## Git
All our work is stored on GitHub in private and public repositories. There are common housekeeping rules that apply to both of the repository types.
- `main` and `master` branches are considered protected and the only commits in these branches should be via the Pull Requests
- all the work is done in `feature/` branches
- if a person wants to get his `feature/` branch merged into the `main` branch, he/she opens a PR and may or may not assign it to a person
- anybody can open any PR
- PRs get merged after a review; review needs to be done by s/b else than the person who logged the PR
- anybody can review and merge anybody else's PR (except of his/her own one)
- we care about the commit and PR [hygiene](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

## Communication
Our communication "defaults to open". This means that by default every information is open to the colleagues (strategic exceptions are expected and will be carefully assessed). The reasons:
1. empowering colleagues - we're all a part of the same business story, we're working together to achieve a success together
2. quality decisions - in a transparent world we're expecting that we get a constructive feedback and we're able to steer the decisions accordingly
As Slack is our communication tool of choice, we take the advantage of `huddle`s. Anybody is welcome to join any huddle.

## Interviews
Interviews are difficult for both - the interviewer and the interviewee. There is a good reason why they are difficult. It is because they are important. We prefer to have three Berops people present on the interviews in order to capture the impressions about the candidate. This way we are able to spot aspects of the candidate's profile that a single person might miss due to the extra load that the interviewer needs to handle.
Anybody is welcome to join any interview until all three seats are taken. All interviews are announced in the `#hiring` channel.

Our culture and this content are subject to further development.
